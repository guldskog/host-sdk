# Hosti SDK (Beta)

## Hi! let's build an app

_We use yarn, make sure you have it globally installed then continue_

---

## Getting started

Download this repository then...

- `yarn` to install dependencies
- `yarn start` to start development
- `yarn build` to package your app in a zip

---

## Version control your app

Create a new branch "`app-{appid}`".

- This branch will never be merged into main.
- This branch will hold all the stuff you've added regarding your app.
- All branches with "`app-`" in their name should be runnable with `yarn start` command.

_If there is updates to the SDK you can merge the SDK into your branch or rebase onto main to get the latest setup._

---

## Contribue to the SDK

If you have improvements to the SDK you can create a "`sdk-{feature}`" branch and then create a pull request into sdk.
