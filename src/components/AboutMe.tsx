      <p className="text-lg">
        Well, my name is Emil Kallioniemi and I'm a 21 year old guy who lives in
        Sundsvall, Sweden.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg">
        On my free time I love spending time together with my girlfriend and my
        daughter who is growing so fast! ðŸ¥°
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg">
        Whenever I have time for it I love exploring, researching and learning
        new stuff related to coding!
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg">
        I'm mostly spending my time on the front-end side of things but I'm also
        interested in learning more about the back-end side of things.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg">
        In summary, I have a huge passion for coding, it's almost addicting!...
